1.Using Window functions, explore the top 3, 5 or 10 customers based on certain metrics (Eg - Find the top 5 customers with highest bank balance who have not defaulted on a loan in the last 2 years). This will help you understand your ideal loan applicants.

WITH RecentNonDefaulters AS (
    SELECT 
        LoanNr_ChkDgt,
        Name,
        City,
        State,
        DisbursementGross,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY DisbursementGross DESC) AS rank
    FROM 
        loan
    WHERE 
        MIS_Status = 'P I F' -- Assuming 'P I F' indicates loans that were paid in full (no default)
        AND (ChgOffDate IS NULL OR ChgOffDate <= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '2 years')
)
SELECT 
    LoanNr_ChkDgt,
    Name,
    City,
    State,
    DisbursementGross
FROM 
    RecentNonDefaulters
WHERE 
    rank <= 5;

2.Write out your final query that creates a column in the table (Refer to the commands in C3) which says whether a customer is eligible for a loan or not based on the criterion you set in the previous component.	

ALTER TABLE loan
ALTER COLUMN LoanEligibility TYPE VARCHAR(12);


WITH RecentNonDefaulters AS (
    SELECT 
        LoanNr_ChkDgt,
        Name,
        City,
        State,
        DisbursementGross,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY DisbursementGross DESC) AS rank
    FROM 
        loan
    WHERE 
        MIS_Status = 'P I F'  -- Assuming 'P I F' indicates loans that were paid in full (no default)
        AND (ChgOffDate IS NULL OR ChgOffDate <= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '2 years')
)
UPDATE loan
SET LoanEligibility = CASE
    WHEN LoanNr_ChkDgt IN (
        SELECT LoanNr_ChkDgt 
        FROM RecentNonDefaulters 
        WHERE rank <= 5
    ) THEN 'Eligible'
    ELSE 'Not Eligible'
END;	
	
	
3.To check which customers are eligible to get loan approval

SELECT LoanNr_ChkDgt, LoanEligibility FROM loan;
SELECT LoanNr_ChkDgt, LoanEligibility FROM loan where  LoanEligibility='Eligible';	
SELECT LoanNr_ChkDgt, Name, City, State, LoanEligibility 
FROM loan 
WHERE LoanEligibility = 'Eligible';
